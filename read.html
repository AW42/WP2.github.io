        <ol style="font-size:20px;">
            <li>Create a GitHub account on github.com.</li>
            
            <li>Download either GitHub for Mac or GitHub for Windows, depending on your operating system. Open the app and log in using the account you just created.</li>
            
            <li>(On Mac): After you login, click advanced and make sure that your name and email are correct. Then, click "Install Command Line Tools", just in case you want to start using the command line later in life.</li>
           
            <li>Create a new repository in your GitHub application. Name it your-username.github.io. The name is very important. Note the folder that GitHub is saving the repository to. Make sure the "Push to GitHub?" box is checked.</li>
            
            <li>Move your website's files into the folder that GitHub just created when you made the repository. IMPORTANT: Your homepage HTML file must be called "index.html", and it must exist in the top-level directory.</li>
           
            <li>Back in the GitHub application, you should see your files in the left column. Make sure they are all checked. If so, enter a message in the text box called "commit summary", something like "initial commit." Then, click the commit button.</li>
            
            <li>Click the "Publish repo" button in the top right corner.</li>
            
            <li>Give it about 10 minutes, then check your-username.github.io. Your website should be there!</li>
