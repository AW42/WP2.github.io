   <h2>Why Am I Different</h2>
   <p class="intro">I am totally a different person. Unlike my friends and cousins, I am an introvert. I love being alone, I enjoy things the way I want, I rarely go out with friends and cousins. I get annoyed very easily and quickly. Past experiences have shaped me into a person that I am today. More importantly, I am unpredictable. In the past I have done a lot of things people never thought I would, many people around me think they know me but I know they don't. After an exhausted day at the university, I love spending time either alone or with my parents.</p>

   <h2>What Can I Contribute</h2>
   <p class="intro">I think before contributing , one really has to identify the problem and problem can never be figured out when you start looking for them, instead it happens when you least expect it. As a computer science student, I would be more than happy to solve a problem within my own domain, since we are living in an era of technology. You never know any incident you might come across then think about it if there is a possiblity of solving it within your own field. </p>
